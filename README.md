## üëãüèΩ About me 

 I am Julio, an enthusiast of data science, digital art and open source projects. During my degree in Computer Science (2001-2005), I wrote several articles in computational vision and artificial neural networks. I have been working in the industry for many years developing solutions for telecommunications, CCTV and aerospace companies. I like to build algorithms to solve problems, perform optimizations, and also build machine learning models to deliver smarter products.
